    "The project follows a structured pipeline, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prerequisites Setup:** Installing and importing all required libraries and tools for Qiskit and quantum computing.\n",
    "* **Defined Constants:** Declaring all configurable constants for qubit count, optimization method, number of shots, data paths etc.\n",
    "* **Data Preparation:** Loading and preprocessing the heart disease dataset, including normalization of input features for quantum encoding.\n",
    "* **Quantum Circuit Preparation:** Designing the quantum feature map, constructing the variational ansatz, and composing the full quantum circuit.\n",
